#strong[Psalm 50]

Have mercy on me, O God, in the greatness of Your compassion; \*
according to the multitude of Your mercies #emph[blot out] #strong[my]
offense.

Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, \* and #emph[cleanse me]
#strong[from] my sin.

#emph[1] For I acknowledge my iniquity, \* and my sin is al#emph[ways
be];#strong[fore] me.

#emph[2] Against You alone have I sinned \* and done what is #emph[evil]
#strong[in] Your sight,

#emph[1] That You may be justified when You speak \* and #emph[win when]
#strong[You] are judged.

#emph[2] Behold, in wickedness I was conceived \* and in sin my
#emph[mother] #strong[bore] me.

#emph[1] For see, You have loved truth; \* You have shown me the hidden
and secret things #emph[of your] #strong[wis];dom.

#emph[2] Sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be clean. \* Wash me and I
#emph[shall be] #strong[whi];ter than snow.

#emph[1] Make me hear joy and gladness; \* the bones #emph[that]
#emph[were] #strong[crushed] shall rejoice.

#emph[2] Turn away Your face from my sins, \* and blot out all #emph[my
i];#strong[ni];quities.

#emph[1] Create in me a pure heart, O God, \* and renew a right
spi#emph[rit with];#strong[in] me.

#emph[2] Cast me not from Your presence, \* nor deprive me of Your
#emph[Holy] #strong[Spi];rit.

#emph[1] Give me again the joy of Your salvation, \* and sustain me with
Your #emph[sovereign] #strong[Spi];rit.

#emph[2] I will teach transgressors Your ways, \* and sinners #emph[will
re];#strong[turn] to You.

#emph[1] Deliver me from blood guilt, O God, the God of my salvation, \*
and my tongue shall ring #emph[out Your] #strong[jus];tice.

#emph[2] Lord, You will open my lips, \* and my mouth #emph[shall
de];#strong[clare] Your praise.

#emph[1] For if You had wanted sacrifice, I would have given it; \* You
will not take pleasure #emph[in burnt] #strong[of];ferings.

#emph[2] A sacrifice to God is a contrite spirit. \* A humbled and
con#emph[trite heart] #strong[God] will not spurn.

#emph[1] Deal favorably, O Lord, with Sion in Your good pleasure \* and
let the walls of Jeru#emph[salem] #strong[be] rebuilt.

#emph[2] Then You will be well-pleased with a sacrifice of justice,
oblations and holocausts; \* then they will lay calves u#emph[pon Your]
#strong[al];tar.
